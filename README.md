// RESTful APIs
In a RESTful API, when a resource is successfully updated, the server typically responds with an appropriate HTTP status code. Here are the most common ones used for this scenario:

HTTP 200 OK:
Indicates the update was successful, and the response may include the updated resource or additional information.
Json{
    "status": 200,
    "message": "Resource updated successfully",
    "data": {
        "id": 123,
        "name": "Updated Name"
    }
}

HTTP 204 No Content:
Indicates the update was successful, but no content is returned in the response body.
Json{
    "status": 204,
    "message": "Resource updated successfully"
}

HTTP 201 Created (if applicable):
If the PUT request resulted in the creation of a new resource (e.g., if the resource didn't exist before), this status code is used.
Json{
    "status": 201,
    "message": "Resource created successfully",
    "data": {
        "id": 456,
        "name": "New Resource"
    }
}


The choice of status code depends on the specific behavior of your API and the expectations of the client consuming it.
